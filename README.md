-- Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera
This is the readme file. This file descripes how the run_analysis.R script works.

#Script
The R script does the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Download the data for the project </li>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement</li>
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names</li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject</li>
</ol>
