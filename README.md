-- Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera
This is the readme file. This file descripes how the run_analysis.R script works.

#Script
The R script does the following steps:

1: Download the data for the project
2: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
3: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
