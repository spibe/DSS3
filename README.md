This is the readme file for the script run_analyses.R
Author: spibe / 23.10.2015

Run the script run_analysis.R from this repo.
This will produce a file called "tidy_data.txt" in the working dir.

The script will check, if you already have the data files in your working dir.
If not, the script will try to download it.
