#run_analysis.R
-- Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera
This is the readme file. This file descripes how the run_analysis.R script works.

#Script
Run the script run_analysis.R from this repo.
This will produce a file called "tidy_data.txt" in the working dir.
The script will check, if you already have the data files in your working dir.
If not, the script will try to download it.
